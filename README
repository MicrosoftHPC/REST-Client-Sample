	There is no prerequisite for Java client. The code is tested with JDK 1.6.

	For C client (under src\cpp\SoaWebApiClient), libcurl and json-c is
	needed. The code has been compiled and tested on Fedora with the following 
	library:
   
		libcurl-7.21.3-8.fc15.x86_64
		libcurl-devel-7.21.3-8.fc15.x86_64
		json-c-0.9-2.fc15.x86_64
		json-c-devel-0.9-2.fc15.x86_64

How to build and use
====================

	To build/run Java client, go to src\java\SoaWebApiClient\src, and run 
	"sh RunTest.sh src" to build, "sh RunTest.sh run" to run.
	(Or RunTest.cmd if you are on Windows).

	To build/run C client, go to src\cpp\SoaWebApiClient. Type "make". And
	follow the instruction of "./soaclient -?".
